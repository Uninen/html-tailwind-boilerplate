# HTML Boilerplate With Tailwind CSS + Vite HMR

Sometimes you just need to get that one HTML page online, fast.

ZERO JavaScript and purged TailwindCSS output for prod, Vite HMR for dev.

## Getting Started

1. Change title, description.
2. Add favicon to `public/` and tweak the corresponding link tag.
3. Add apple touch icon to `public/icon.png` (or remove corresponding file + line from HEAD).
4. Add your content and style it with Tailwind CSS.
